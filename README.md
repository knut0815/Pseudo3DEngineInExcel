Pseudo 3D Engine in Excel


ReadMe

This excel file allows you to gain an intuitive understanding of how rasterizing works, in the basic setting of an excel workbook.

I hope this is of help for those trying to learn the basics of computer graphics - as I was just recently!


Instructions:

First, you need to go to the sheet named "Pseudo 3D"

Next, you need to run the macro called "Play" - you can do this using the "PLAY" button

This macro assigns new functionality to the following keys
 - "w": press this to walk forward
 - "s": press this to walk backward
 - "a": press this to move left
 - "d": press this to move right
 - "q": press this to turn left
 - "e": press this to turn right
 - "esc": press this to end the game and reset all key functionality
NOTE: this macro overrides these key's normal functionality - you must press ESC or press the EXIT button at the end to reenble these keys in excel to their original functionality

The map can be changed by adding a wall with "1" and removing a wall with "0".
